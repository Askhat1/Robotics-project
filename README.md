# Robotics Project: Helmet Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting helmets and masks on construction sites using YOLOv8. The goal is to improve safety by identifying workers who are not wearing the required safety gear.

## Features
- Real-time helmet and mask detection.
- Custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
- Live demo using a webcam or video file.
